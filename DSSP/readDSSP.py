"""
Structural Bioinformatics assignment 1 - Phi-psi angles

When you finish the assignment, the script should create an
output file containing the amino acid propensities to be buried
in the protein core. Please ONLY modify the code in the two
indicated blocks and do NOT use additional python packages.

To run, make 'DSSP' your working directory and use:

> python3 readDSSP.py Data/
