# Assignment 1 - Structural bioinformatics

### Introduction
The aim of this practical is to assign secondary structure, given the PDB coordinates of a protein structure. Note that secondary structure assignment is something fundamentally different from secondary structure prediction - please make sure you are well aware of this difference. Note that most students find section 1 of this assignment most difficult. If you get stuck, please continue with section 2 and ask for help in the next class.

### Assignment
Make sure you run the scripts in the correct folder ('Assignment1/PDB') or 'Assignment1/DSSP') as your working directory, to ensure that the output files are written into the 'Output' folder. Examples of how to run the scripts are provided in each of the Python files. You can make this assignment in groups of two, however, everyone needs to hand in the assignment individually. If you work together, please clearly state your own name, and the name of your partner. Please keep your answers concise.
